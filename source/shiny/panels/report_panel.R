  p("Crime is an issue that many people deeply care about. Crime influences important 
  issues such as our economy and political opinions. Crime rates can vary wildly 
  between different neighborhoods within a city. As an example, downtown Seattle 
  is known for having a higher rate of crime compared to the rest of the city. 
  Our area of research for this project intends to dive deeply into crime data and 
  understand trends that exist within that data. Additionally, we want to identify 
  what kinds of correlations we can draw with crime from other data such as income rates. 
  We will utilize two datasets containing crime and income data within Seattle neighborhoods 
  over the past decade. Our goal is to capture meaningful information that Seattle politicians 
  can utilize to make informed policy decisions that reduce crime in our city. We all would like 
  to make Seattle a safer place to live"),

  p("**Framing**: The topic of concern is crime in Seattle. There are multiple elements 
  making this topic, namely: crime types, crime rates, areas of crime, income. Moreover, 
  there are several questions to be asked about:
  - Does *income* have a causal relationship with *crime rates*?
  - What are the *factors* of a neighborhood in Seattle that affect *crime rate* in that area?
  - What are the most prominent *types of crime* in Seattle?
 **Human values**: Our project concerns with moral values categorized into these factors: 
 *Personal-sexual*, *Social Trust*, *Legal-illegal*, *Self-interest*, which are the moral 
 factors discussed in the article _MORAL VALUES, SOCIAL TRUST AND INEQUALITY: Can Values 
 Explain Crime?_ [^1] In this study, general measures of moral values and tolerances have 
 little to no relationships with the covariants of crime, but a sub-set of *Self-interest* 
 items offer some explanations. *Self-interest* values directly associates with crime rates 
 at national levels. Surprisingly, *Standard of Living* and *Social Trust* was not found to 
 be responsible for crime rates, rather, they offered to be conditions for the variance of 
 crime in difference settings.

 **Stakeholders**: Our project is open to the public, therefore citizens, politicians, journalists, 
 law practitioners get access to our data. These individuals then can help influence the policies 
 and laws to make people' lives safer. Internally, the criminal justice system includes those who 
 are responsible for enforcing and interpreting the law. Internal stakeholders of the criminal 
 justice system could potentially include persons who are suspected of crimes and convicted. 
 Externally, the media, groups that serve victims of crime, families, businesses, school and 
 society can be impacted. [^3] People who consume media that use our project's
 data can be influenced by the media' narratives. Similarly, people who are influenced by 
 the politicians' and law practitioners' interpretations of our data can have a different 
 viewpoint about these crimes and the elements surrounding them.

 **Benefits and Harms**: In general, since these data about crimes are unbiased,
 the public are expected to have an objective and more comprehensive view of the crimes, 
 the income, and the direct stakeholders. Law enforcement can better make a case to acquire 
 these resources needed to fight crime. [^2] Crime-fighting problems can be addressed to find 
 solutions.
 On the other hand, direct stakeholders can misinterpret the data in order to spread mis/disinformation 
 for unethical/selfish motives. Insufficient data could also cause data errors that shape the results 
 in unintentional ways. Moreover, social media can have a bias view of this data, representing a false 
 narrative of crime data. This following figure shows the difference between frequencies of different 
 types of crimes against crime-related tweets. [^4]"),
