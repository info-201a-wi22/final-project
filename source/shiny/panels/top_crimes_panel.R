    this data is comparing Assuault Offenses from 2013 to 2019. Overall crime increased
    but Assuault Offenses was one of the largest increases with a difference of 2,426
    from 2013 to 2019. Another notable observation is Trespassing on Property over 
    tripled from 2013 to 2019. Overall I think understanding how King County has 
    changed overtime in regard to crime offenses is useful because it allows us as 
    a community to understand where we can improve and work to uplift the people 
    around us to limit crime.")
