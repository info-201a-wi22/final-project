  p("With the data shown in our visualizations, there are many important 
    findings. We can see from the crime map that downtown Seattle has the 
    most criminal activity amongst all the top 10 crime groups in Seattle,
    which is shown in the 'Top Crimes' tab. This is not very suprising 
    information beause these numbers are spiked due to many factors like high 
    homeless levels, higher gang activity, higher poverty rates, and/or more 
    growing population. If we also take a look at the 'Income and Crime Rate' 
    tab, we can see that crime is clearly closely related with income, no
    matter the category of crime. When there is an increase in income, there
    is almost an equal decrease in crime. Larceny-Theft is and has been a big
    problem in Seattle. We can see this from the 'Top Crime' tab, as 
    Larceny-Theft is by far the largest crime group, with over 200,000 crimes from
    the years 2013-2019."),
  h3("Conclusion"),
  p("All in all, our prject is very important to the city of Seattle and the
    people who live in it. Our data can be very helpful to many different
    people, whether it be to people in important settings like technologists, 
    designers, policymaker or just to people visiting or looking to live in 
    Seattle. It allows people to make choices to be in certain areas and how 
    cautious you need to be when going to a specific location within Seattle.
    Also, crime is a major thing that should be talked about in any big city
    in any state. Big cities like Seattle suffer from criminal activity and 
    these types of projects is were we start to actually take a look at what 
    we need to do as a community to change for the future.")
