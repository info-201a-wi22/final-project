        important issues such as our economy and political opinions. Crime rates
        can vary wildly between different neighborhoods within a city. As an 
        example, downtown Seattle is known for having a higher rate of crime 
        compared to the rest of the city. Our area of research for this project 
        intends to dive deeply into crime data and understand trends that exist 
        within that data."),

        draw with crime from other data such as income rates. We will utilize 
        two datasets containing crime and income data within Seattle 
        neighborhoods over the past decade. Our goal is to capture meaningful 
        information that Seattle politicians can utilize to make informed policy 
        decisions that reduce crime in our city. We all would like to make 
        Seattle a safer place to live."),

        of crime rates over the different neighborhoods within the city. The 
        answer to these questions will help us understand whether crime in 
        Seattle is improving or getting worse. We can compare trends within 
        different neighborhoods to identify which neighborhoods handle crime 
        better than others. We want to see if a correlation exists between crime
