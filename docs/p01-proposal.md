# Title of your Project: Project Proposal

**TODO**: Edit this file. Your project proposal goes here. Save and delete the developer notes when done.

## Developer Notes

* **Where is the project brief?**  [`../instructions/project-design-brief.pdf`](../instructions/project-design-brief.pdf).
* **Making Progress**: We understand this work might be difficult. Also, we understand that your project ideas might not be completely worked out. So, we ask that you do the best you can. You will receive specific guidance from your TA and constructive feedback. We are confident that you will succeed!
* **What should be included in the proposal?** Every proposal will be different. It depends on your particular project.  That said, in the table below you will find the expected report elements.  It is important that you engage with and respond to the the Design Brief.
* **How should the proposal be formatted?** You should format your proposal using Markdown in this file. You should aim for a professional presentation - clear, concise, interesting, and free of spelling and grammatical errors.
* **What headings should we use?** As needed, the suggested headings below can be revised and new headings and sub-headings can be added. Please use headings, bullet lists, tables, figures, and other markdown code effectively - seek a professional presentation.
* **Finishing up.** When you are finished writing and formatting your proposal, save these developer notes(they might useful in the future). Then, delete them.
* **Questions?** If you have questions, please ask your TA or post on Teams.

|Element | Brief Description|
|---------------| --------------
|Code name | Give your project a _code name_, a short, evocative name for efficiently referring to your project. Your code name does not change! Examples: _Jazz-4_, _Rocking Fish_, etc. |
|Project title| Give your project a concise, interesting title that summarizes the entirety of your project. (Your title can change on subsequent deliverables.) |
|Authors | Names of your team members and contact information (email addresses). |
|Affiliation |  INFO-201: Technical Foundations of Informatics - The Information School - University of Washington |
|Date | Winter 2022|
|Abstract | No more than three sentences that summarize your project. Focus on the very most important aspects. For example: **(1)** "Our main question is .... This question is important because .... To address the question, we will ...." **(2)** "We are concerned with ..., becuase .... To address this concern, we plan to ...." **(3)** "Consider that ....  This is important because .... Accordingly, we plan to ...."   |
|Keywords | 3-5 keywords that summarize your project.  (e.g., "Keywords: human physiology; bicycle exercise; elderly; power and heart rate times-series data") |
|1.0 Introduction | Briefly introduce your project. (about 150 words) |
|2.0 Design Situation | Use short sub-sections to describe your topic and the setting (that is, the sociotechnical situation), including project framing, human values, direct and indirect stakeholders, possible harms and benefits. See the Design Brief, section B.3. **Note**: You *must* include three citations to related work (URLs to similar work, high quality articles from the popular press, reseach papers, etc. ). You may find it helpful to include a figure.  (about 400 words) |
|3.0 Research questions | 3-5 research questions. What motivates the questions? Why are they important? See the Deign Brief, section B.4. (about 150 words) |
# 4.0 The Dataset
The datasets that we chose to analyze are crime data in Seattle that ranges from 2008 to present and then data about Seattle's household income that has average household income by location from 2013 to 2019.
##Data set size and complexity
The data consists of 2 csv files with the crime data having 950,000 observations and 17 columns and the income data having 915 observations and 8 columns. 
## Data Provenance
For both data sets the data being represented is based off of the population in King County for a given year. Observations in the crime data set are represented by a report number and broken down into the time the crime took place, location, and offense. The observations of the income data are broken down into year, average household income, and location. The crime data was collected and maintained by Seattle Police Department until May 2019 when the preservation and upkeep of the data moved to the National Incident-Based Reporting System (NIBRS). The main purpose of this data is to obviously keep track of crimes in Seattle for keeping records but also beneficial to understand more about crime in Seattle when it is represented in such a large dataset. This data benefits the people of Seattle and the United States as a whole because it represents how crime has evolved and changed in the last 14 years and allows us to determine if we are making a meaningful difference at combating crime and if not where we can improve. The income by location data we found is presented by DATAUSA but originated from the U.S. Census Bureau. The purpose of the income by location dataset is to understand how Seattle’s income has evolved over the years and also to compare different parts of Seattle. The data alone doesn’t necessarily benefit anyone in particular but is useful to understand the trend of our economy and shows how certain areas of Seattle are more expensive than others. Overall both of these datasets should be considered credible and trustworthy because they originate from government agencies.
