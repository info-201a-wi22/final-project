**Abstract** :  We are interested in identifying trends within crime rates in Seattle. This is an important topic to understand because it can ultimately be used to influence policy that makes our lives safer. To address this question, we will utilize data collected over the past decade regarding crime rates in Seattle.

## 1.0 Introduction
Crime is an issue that many people deeply care about. Crime influences important issues such as our economy and political opinions. Crime rates can vary wildly between different neighborhoods within a city. As an example, downtown Seattle is known for having a higher rate of crime compared to the rest of the city. Our area of research for this project intends to dive deeply into crime data and understand trends that exist within that data. Additionally, we want to identify what kinds of correlations we can draw with crime from other data such as income rates. We will utilize two datasets containing crime and income data within Seattle neighborhoods over the past decade. Our goal is to capture meaningful information that Seattle politicians can utilize to make informed policy decisions that reduce crime in our city. We all would like to make Seattle a safer place to live.

## 2.0 Design Situation

Use short sub-sections to describe your topic and the setting (that is, the sociotechnical situation), including project framing, human values, direct and indirect stakeholders, possible harms and benefits. See the Design Brief, section B.3. **Note**: You *must* include three citations to related work (URLs to similar work, high quality articles from the popular press, reseach papers, etc. ). You may find it helpful to include a figure.  (about 400 words) |

## 3.0 Research questions
Our questions revolve around identifying trends in crime rates within Seattle. The questions that we want to explore are:
 - What _types_ of crime are the most common in Seattle?
 - How have the crime rates _changed_ over the decade?
 - How does the crime rate _differ_ between neighborhoods within Seattle?
 - What _areas_ of Seattle have the highest crime rates?
 - What is the _relationship_ between income and crime rates in Seattle?  

We will address these questions by creating visualizations of crime rates over the different neighborhoods within the city. The answer to these questions will help us understand whether crime in Seattle is improving or getting worse. We can compare trends within different neighborhoods to identify which neighborhoods handle crime better than others. We want to see if a correlation exists between crime rates and income rates within Seattle.

## 4.0 The Dataset
The datasets that we chose to analyze are crime data in Seattle that ranges from 2008 to present and then data about Seattle's household income that has average household income by location from 2013 to 2019.
### Data set size and complexity
The data consists of 2 csv files with the crime data having 950,000 observations and 17 columns and the income data having 915 observations and 8 columns.
### Data Provenance
For both data sets the data being represented is based off of the population in King County for a given year. Observations in the crime data set are represented by a report number and broken down into the time the crime took place, location, and offense. The observations of the income data are broken down into year, average household income, and location. The crime data was collected and maintained by Seattle Police Department until May 2019 when the preservation and upkeep of the data moved to the National Incident-Based Reporting System (NIBRS). The main purpose of this data is to obviously keep track of crimes in Seattle for keeping records but also beneficial to understand more about crime in Seattle when it is represented in such a large dataset. This data benefits the people of Seattle and the United States as a whole because it represents how crime has evolved and changed in the last 14 years and allows us to determine if we are making a meaningful difference at combating crime and if not where we can improve. The income by location data we found is presented by DATAUSA but originated from the U.S. Census Bureau. The purpose of the income by location dataset is to understand how Seattle’s income has evolved over the years and also to compare different parts of Seattle. The data alone doesn’t necessarily benefit anyone in particular but is useful to understand the trend of our economy and shows how certain areas of Seattle are more expensive than others. Overall both of these datasets should be considered credible and trustworthy because they originate from government agencies.

## 5.0 Expected Implications
Answering the research questions would create implications for a lot of important settings. Technologists, designers, and policymakers could make many implications based on our topic answers. An implication that might come up based on our research and our topic is that crime rates are or are not affected by income levels. Technologists finding a way to use more advanced technology to lower crime rates would be very effective and has been very effective for other cities. A designer creating a better built environment with better takes on zoning, designs of streets and housing, locations of public transit, and land uses would shape the built environment in ways that could possibly reduce crime. A policymaker could help lower crime rates by creating more incentives for people who need treatment or vocational programs in prison so when they get out they have something to look forward to instead of doing something to get them back in jail.  


## 6.0 Limitations
There are many limitations when it comes to research on certain topics, especially when they might be specific to a smaller group. Some limitations that could very possibly come up that could have to do with our topic is a lack of data. Since our topic is specific to one city instead of a state or even the world, there could be a shortage of data we can actually find, which could also lead to a lack of sample sizes for the important information we need to collect for our specific topic. Also data that is being reported based on one's self could also be a problem, as everyone has biases when it comes to race and culture, other things take place when people try to give out information in these situations like having selective memory, telescoping, attribution, or exaggeration. Problems like prior research and time constraint would be based on our dedication to getting our work complete.
